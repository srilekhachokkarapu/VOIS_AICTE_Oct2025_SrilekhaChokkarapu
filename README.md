üè† Airbnb Data Analytics: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Project Overview

This project involves conducting a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on an Airbnb Open Data dataset. The primary goal is to clean unstructured raw data and uncover key market trends, geographical pricing disparities, and factors that influence listing prices.

üéØ Objectives

    Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, standardize column names, and convert inconsistent currency/string formats to numerical types.

    Geographic Analysis: Analyze the distribution of listings and average prices across different neighborhood groups.

    Feature Influence: Determine the impact of room_type, number_of_reviews, and minimum_nights on the final listing price.

    Visualization: Present findings using informative charts (Histograms, Box Plots, Heatmaps) for clear insights.

üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

    Language: Python 3.x

    Environment: Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

    Libraries:

        Pandas (Data manipulation and preprocessing)

        NumPy (Numerical operations)

        Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data visualization)

üìä Key Findings

    Price Disparity: Manhattan has the highest average listing price, while Brooklyn has the highest volume of listings.

    Room Type Impact: Listings categorized as Entire home/apt are significantly more expensive than Private room and Shared room options.

    Review Activity: A weak negative correlation exists between price and number_of_reviews, suggesting that the most frequently reviewed listings are often lower-priced due to higher customer turnover.
